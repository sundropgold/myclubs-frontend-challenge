# myClubs Frontend Challenge

## About

This is a small challenge to assess your frontend dev skills. You should invest no more than 2 hours in completing it. The instructions contain all the information you need, everything else is up to your own judgement. There is no right or wrong solution, only your personal approach. Feel free to use any library, boilerplate, tool,… that you like. Don’t be afraid to use easy/convenient solutions. We are as much interested in your reasoning as we are in the result. Feel free to ask questions at any time.

## Deliverable

Fork this repository and submit you result as pull request. One should be able to run it by cloning your repository and running:

```
npm install
npm start
```

## What You Should Create

Create a simple screen that displays one of our sports activities with a call to action asking the user to book it. Your app should fetch the data from this endpoint:

```
https://frontend-challenge-190ff.firebaseio.com/activities/coding-activity.json
```

Upon clicking on the button you should show the user a confirmation that his booking was successful.
